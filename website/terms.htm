				MetaWallet provides users with a secure and private environment to store, download, share, and print contact information. You also understand and agree that the Service may include certain communications from MetaWallet, such as service announcements, and administrative messages, and that these communications are considered part of the Service and you will not be able to opt out of receiving them. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS IS" and that MetaWallet assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, failure to deliver information, or failure to store information.  You understand and acknowledge that many aspects of the Service are based upon and depend upon one or more "best efforts" infrastructures (including the Internet and the SMS networks operated by mobile telephone service providers) that are operated and controlled by third parties not under our control.  As such, MetaWallet cannot warrant or guaranty the successful transmission of any Content using the Service.  You acknowledge and agree that you may be charged for your attempted use of the Service notwithstanding the failure of any such attempt to result in a successful transmission of Content.
				<p>
You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service and that access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service provider or mobile telephone service airtime or other charges). You are solely responsible for those fees. In addition, you must provide and are solely responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service.
<p>
Most US mobile telephone service providers charge for receiving Short Message Service (SMS) messages, such as contacts or other Content sent by the Service. This charge is separate from and in addition to MetaWallet's fees. Please consult your mobile service provider's pricing plan to determine the charges for sending and receiving SMS messages.

				The Terms constitutes the entire agreement between you and MetaWallet and govern your use of the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software. The Terms and the relationship between you and MetaWallet shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and MetaWallet agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of King County, Washington. The failure of MetaWallet to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
